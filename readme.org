** data
   - for physio see https://github.com/WillForan/processPhysio_matlab/blob/master/physio_proc_wallace.m
   - for preprocessing see local
     - see ~/src/restPreproc/ to generate rest_preproc_mni.nii.gz (find /data/Luna1/Reward/Rest -name rest_preproc_mni.nii.gz )
   - need mni template and 244 ROIs
  
the rest we make (see [[Data]])


** install/using drake
 1. install lein and drip 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
   curl https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein > ~/bin/lein
   curl -L http://drip.flatland.org > ~/bin/drip
   # add export "PATH=$PATH:~/bin" to .bashrc/.profile/.zshrc/whatever if it's not there
#+END_SRC

2. get drake

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
 git clone git@github.com:Factual/drake.git
 cd drake && lein uberjar
 echo "export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
 . ~/.bashrc
#+END_SRC

* Data
** Test
   Process is based on Aarthi's preprocessing (Skynet:Phillips/rest_preproc_redo_AP) which is replicated by scotts (rest_preproc_redo_SM)
   This is validated with subject 10845. Subject 10152 is different though. See ../rest_preproc_nophysio_withphysiotest
