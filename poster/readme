SHOW:

 Including physio regressors changes estimated roi-roi interaction over development
   - in network of 9 highlighted roi's sensitive to development 
   - over whole brain (244 rois), top .1% 
 
IMAGES:

  ../imgs/lm/ageinv/devel/     correlation by age via linear model:
  ../imgs/suma/                ROIs/connections on suma brain

  * roi-roi correlation by age
    - ordered by pipeline*slope interaction signficance (slope between w/ and w/o physio most different)
    - inv age model, ploted with age linear

  * suma brains
    - nodes are rois 
      - black equal sized 
      - colored and sized by number of connections
         - useful when looking at eg. only top .1% of signficant slope differences
	 - useless over selected 9 development ROIs
    - edges colored by
      - t value
      - difference in slope between w/ and w/o physio
    - brain
      - full but transparent mesh
      - no brain (just network)
      - one hemisphere not shown

TODO:
 - decided on suma images to show
    - half brain, no brain, transparent brain?
    - edge color represntation: t-value or changeinslope
       - do edge weight is t, color is slope change ?

 - connect roi-roi R plots to suma nodes

 - illustrate pipeline
